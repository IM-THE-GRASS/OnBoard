# Hackmouse

The project is a pcb for a mouse that uses the PMW3360 sensor from pixart and a Xiao microcontroller from Seeed studio. 
I made it so that i can possibly make a YSWS for the project is the future. Its going to be a wired mouse for now but I could slso solder on some batteries to make it wireless. 
The sensor has up to 1600 dpi and is a very high end sensor overall while the buttons are pretty average micro switches.

I spent a lot of time trying to find a senor that was high end but also was relitivly simple to implement. This one isn't quite as easy as just connectinf power and data but it was pretty close.
